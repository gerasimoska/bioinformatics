## Molecular biology examples using Python
### dna_validation
DNA is made up of molecules called nucleotides. Each nucleotide contains a phosphate group, a sugar group and a nitrogen base. The four types of nitrogen bases are adenine (A), thymine (T), guanine (G) and cytosine (C).<br>
DNA sequence is valid if it contains only these bases, and it starts and ends with the appropriate nucleotide triplets.
### rna_validation
RNA also contains four different bases and starts and ends with specific triplets. Three of these bases the same as in DNA: adenine, guanine, and cytosine. RNA contains uracil (U) instead of thymine (T).

### complementary_dna_strand
Two chains that make up a double helix of DNA, with corresponding positions on the two chains being composed of a pair of complementary bases, are complementary DNA strands.

### transcription
The central dogma of molecular biology describes the two-step process, transcription and translation, by which the information in genes flows into proteins: DNA → RNA → protein.<br>
Transcription is the synthesis of an RNA copy of a segment of DNA.
### translation
The process by which RNA is used to produce proteins is called translation.<br>
The input used, BRCA1 is a human tumor suppressor gene (also known as a caretaker gene) and is responsible for repairing DNA

### gene_mutation
A gene mutation is a permanent alteration in the DNA sequence that makes up a gene, such that the sequence differs from what is found in most people.<br>
The example shows random mutation in the nucleotide sequence, which will be translated in a protein.
